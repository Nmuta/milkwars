# ANIMATRON PROJECT


This is a fun project to explore keyframe animation using Animatron 


*  Fork and clone this repo. It has some raw files you can use to build the project
*  Start an account an Animatron.com
*  View the tutorials and get started early if you think you can start figuring out the basics
*  Your first step could be to animate a simple object, like a circle, across the screen
*  Your task for today is to create a fun and interesting animation with a few different scenes
*  Animatron has examples on their website. 
*  I've created this demo animation that you can try to build as a challenge using the files in this repo : 
*  https://www.animatron.com/project/394f7956a9863787714232bb
*  Have fun !  Today we're exploring a new topic which may be foreign to you, but it provides several rich experiences with graphics and animation that are outside of the normal scope of the class
